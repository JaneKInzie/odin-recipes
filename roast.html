        <h1>Roast with Potatoes and Carrots</h1>
        <main>
        <p>This is a dinner you need to plan for but it is such a good feeling to come home from work to the smell of roast in the crockpot.</p>
        <p>I put this going before work and let the crock pot do it's thing the whole day. Roast is a great meal for cold winter days...or to impress your
            mother-in-law. I line my slow cooker with a bag specially made for slow cookers, and it makes clean up so much easier.</p>
