    <h3>Michigan Style Pasty</h3>
    <main>
        <p>The pasty is an upper penninsula of Michigan staple. In times past, it was the main dish taken into the copper mines. 
        Miners enjoyed pasties because they could be eaten hot or cold, were easily held in the hand, and were an inexpensive, yet filling, meal.</p>
        <p>Today, pasties are made in many countries and include an assortment of meats and vegetables. This recipe is for the "old fashioned" type
        eaten in the mines.</p>
        <p>Pasties are one of my family's favorite meals. When we get together for holidays, vacations, or just visiting, our family works together to make
            these. From the time we are old enough to hold a knife, we have been taught to peal and cube potatoes, to feel the filling and adjust salt and 
            pepper accordingly, and how to roll out and seal a perfect crust.</p>
            <p>I hope you will enjoy this meal as much as I do!</p>
