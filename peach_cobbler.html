            <p>This quick and easy peach cobbler recipe is a crowd pleaser. I learned this recipe while working at a North Carolina style barbeque restaurant
                where it was a staple dessert item. It is one of my family's favorite desserts, especially when served with vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Two 29 ounce cans sliced peaches in syrup</li>
                <li>One cup of milk</li>
                <li>One heaping cup self-rising flour</li>
                <li>One heaping cup of sugar</li>
                <li>One stick of butter</li>
                <li>Vanilla ice cream (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
